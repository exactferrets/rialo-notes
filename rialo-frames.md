# How Rialo builds Farcaster Frames

> Quick breakdown of how @rialo_io simplifies Frame deployment and customization.

---

##  1. What are Frames?

Frames are interactive objects inside Farcaster posts.  
They are built using:

- JSON metadata (frame spec)
- URL-based rendering
- Stateless backend logic

They act like **buttons for Web3**, letting users interact without leaving their client.

##  2. Where Rialo comes in

Rialo simplifies dev workflow by offering:

- `rialo deploy` â€” one-liner CLI deployment
-  UI customization without low-level frontend work
-  Built-in schema builder (custom fields/buttons)
-  Self-custodial identity using GitHub

It's DevX-first â€” no infra headaches.

##  3. The Dev Experience

Using Rialo CLI, you can:
- Create a Frame config in minutes
- Deploy to their infrastructure
- Get a hosted, sharable Frame instantly

No `vercel`, no `docker`, no hosting â€” just code & go.

## ðŸ§  Final Thoughts

Rialo abstracts away boilerplate and gives **composable UX power** to builders.  
It feels like a framework for the social layer of Web3.
