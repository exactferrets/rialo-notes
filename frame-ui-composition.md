#  Thoughts on UI Composition in Frames

Rialo's approach to Frame customization feels more like building with Lego blocks than traditional dev:

- Button layout
- Color choices
- Inline logic
- Field schema generation

This is powerful because:
-  You don't need full UI frameworks
-  You can reuse logic across Frames
-  Ideal for devs who prefer backend over frontend

If this evolves into a modular Frame UI builder, we're looking at something like **Notion for Web3 UX**.
